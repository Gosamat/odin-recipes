            <li> 1 large egg </li>
            <li> ¼ cup milk </li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place flour in a bowl. Whisk egg and milk in a separate bowl. Combine panko, salt, and pepper in a third bowl.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Coat calamari rings first in flour, then in egg mixture, and finally in panko mixture.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place rings in the basket of the air fryer so that none overlap. Work in batches if needed. Spray tops with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 4 minutes. Flip rings, spray with nonstick cooking spray, and cook until browned and crispy, about 3 minutes more.</li>
         </ol>
