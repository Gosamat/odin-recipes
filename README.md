My Current Project

Currently I'm learning basic HTML to create a website by using the Odin Project.
Been interesting so far, I've previously had some HTML experience during work but that was mostly me just looking at a wall of code and trying to find out why text was weird and then just googling the answer.

This current task is a test of my HTML skills gained from the Odin Project so far, creating a recipe page which then includes other pages with the recipes themselves.

Been enjoying HTML a lot, let's see where it goes.

P.S- also been doing all of this with my keyboard set to US and boy has it been an experience relearning where certain characters are, but it does make it easier to follow instructions on the web since most stuff is based on US keyboard layout.

Still trying to get the hang of visual studio as the previous git stuff I did was on the ubuntu terminal itself
